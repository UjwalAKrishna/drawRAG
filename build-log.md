# Build Log - Plug-and-Play RAG Builder

## Project Analysis & Setup

**PRD Analysis:**
The PRD is well-structured and clear. Key insights:
- Focus on MVP with drag-and-drop UI for RAG pipeline creation
- Plugin architecture for extensibility (Data Sources, Vector DBs, LLMs)
- Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Backend: FastAPI with modular design
- Start with basic components: SQLite + Chroma + OpenAI

**Proposed Development Approach:**
1. Start with frontend drag-and-drop UI to visualize the concept
2. Create basic component blocks (Data Source, Vector DB, LLM)
3. Implement connection system between blocks
4. Build FastAPI backend skeleton
5. Add plugin system foundation
6. Integrate components for working MVP

**Project Structure Decision:**
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/           # HTML, CSS, JS files
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # FastAPI application
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/           # Plugin directory
â””â”€â”€ build-log.md      # This file
```

This approach prioritizes rapid prototyping while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### âœ… Architecture Cleanup & Plugin Structure Fix (Iterations 1-3)
- **Fixed plugin architecture** by moving all plugins outside backend to root level
- **Separated core framework from plugins** - backend contains only core services
- **Updated import structure** to properly handle plugin loading from external directory
- **Corrected project structure** to follow proper separation of concerns
- **Updated documentation** to reflect clean architecture

**Corrected Project Structure:**
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/              # Core framework ONLY
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Core services (plugin_manager, pipeline_manager, base_plugin)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py        # Data models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py          # FastAPI app
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/             # All plugins external to backend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ llm/            # LLM plugins (openai, ollama)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vectordb/       # Vector DB plugins (chroma, faiss)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasource/     # Data source plugins
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ embedding/      # Embedding plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/           # Web interface
â””â”€â”€ [config files]     # Installation, testing, documentation
```

**Benefits of Clean Architecture:**
- Clear separation between core framework and plugins
